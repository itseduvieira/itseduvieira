## 🚀 About Me

I'm Eduardo, an Engineering Manager with 17+ years of experience delivering software across startups, government platforms, and global enterprises. I've built and led high-performing remote teams, launched complex B2B products, and scaled an EMM SaaS as a Google-certified partner.

Lately, I've been focused on **AI platform engineering**: deploying and automating LLMs, fine-tuning open-source models, building agent workflows, and managing GPU inference clusters.

I believe in **remote-first leadership**, async communication, and engineering cultures that ship - not just talk.
